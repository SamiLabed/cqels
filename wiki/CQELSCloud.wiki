CQELS Cloud Performance Tests

= Introduction =

Linked Stream Data extends the Linked Data paradigm to dynamic data sources. It enables the integration and joint processing of heterogeneous stream data sources and data from the Linked Data Cloud. Several Linked Stream Data processing engines exist but their scalability still needs to be in improved in terms of (static and dynamic) data sizes, number of concurrent queries, stream update frequencies, etc. Moreover, none of them yet supports parallel processing in the Cloud, i.e., elastic load profiles in a hosted environment. To remedy these limitations, we present an approach for elastically parallelizing the continuous ex- ecution of queries over Linked Stream Data. For this, we have developed novel and highly efficient and scalable parallel algorithms for continuous query operators. Our approach and algorithms are implemented in our CQELS Cloud system and we present extensive evaluations of its supe- rior performance on Amazon EC2 demonstrating its high scalability and excellent elasticity.

In this tutorial we will describe the required steps for setting up a distributed, multinode CQELS Cloud cluster backed by the Storm, HBase and Hadoop Distributed File System, running on Ubuntu Linux.
