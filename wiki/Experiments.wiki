experiment.  The authors of research papers are recorded the position by RFID tags. These authors have their publication information stored in a DBLP dataset.
To enhance the conference experience, each participant would have access to
the following services, which can all be modeled as continuous
queries:
 
 * Query 1:  Inform a participant about the name and description of
   the location he just entered,
